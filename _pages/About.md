H﻿ello! I’m a Pre-doctoral Research Professional at the Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago. Currently, I work with [Anjali Adukia](https://voices.uchicago.edu/anjali/) and the wonderful team at the [MiiE lab](https://voices.uchicago.edu/miielab/) to examine inequality in representation in education using natural language processing and computer vision techniques. I also work on development projects that explore the relationship between education, marriage, health, migration, and individuals’ fixed physical characteristics such as skin color in Bangladesh and Ghana.

Broadly, I am interested in development economics and labor economics with a focus on education and gender, particularly in examining how social interactions transmit preferences that shape socio-economic outcomes. 

My long-term goal is to use a combination of methods such as field experiments, quasi-experiments, and computational tools to conduct research that benefits people living on the periphery in developing countries, and in the US.

I received an undergraduate degree with triple majors in mathematics, economics, and history from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a Master of Public Policy degree from the University of Chicago.

Outside of work, I play the harp and have had the pleasure of performing at several Chicago Public Libraries and religious institutions! :)
