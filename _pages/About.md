Hello! I am a second-year PhD student at Harvard studying education policy, development economics, and data science. I examine how dynamic human interactions transmit preferences that shape individuals' educational and socioeconomic outcomes. Methodologically, I develop computational methods, including techniques in natural language processing and computer vision, to construct large-scale datasets from historical and contemporary archives. I also conduct field experiments, employ causal inference methods, and draw insights from behavioral sciences and the humanities.

Previously, I worked as a Predoctoral Fellow and the Director of Computer Vision at the [MiiE lab](https://voices.uchicago.edu/miielab/) at the Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago. I received my undergraduate degree with triple majors in mathematics, economics, and history from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a Master of Public Policy from the University of Chicago.

Outside of work, I play the harp and have had the pleasure of performing at several Chicago Public Libraries and cultural institutions! :)
