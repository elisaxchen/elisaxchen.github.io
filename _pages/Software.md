[MiiENLP](https://github.com/miielab/miienlp): 
The MiiENLP open source package is a one stop shop for social scientists to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze texts and derive meaningful results. We created this package with the aim of making NLP and machine-implemented content analysis techniques more accessible to the general users who have zero or limited proficiency in python. We hope these tools will help you catalyze new research in computational social sciences.
