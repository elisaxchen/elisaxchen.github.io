Welcome! I’m a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago. Currently, I work with Anjali Adukia and the wonderful team at the [MiiE lab](https://voices.uchicago.edu/miielab/) to examine inequality in representation using natural language processing and computer vision techniques. I also work on development projects that explore the relationship between education, marriage, health, migration, and individuals’ fixed physical characteristics such as skin color in Bangladesh and Ghana. 

Broadly, I am interested in development economics with a focus on gender and political economy. My long-term goal is to use a combination of methods such as field experiments and computational tools to conduct research that benefits people living on the periphery in developing countries, and in the US.
